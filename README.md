#  HapticBeats with Phunware Ads

Can we create a cool experience by combining haptic feedback with the beats of a song?
See Banner ads in the Bottom Footer
When select Song Interstitial ads will appear

## Requirements

- Xcode 8.3
- iOS 10.1+
- Any iPhone with a vibration motor (although 7 is preferred, and 6s is better than older)

## How it works

Apps checks the peak sound output for all the channels and compares it to the last check. If there was a huge spike, it plays a haptic feedback (which can be hard or soft, depending on intensity of spike). This would be fine for music that is just all beats, but music with other sounds (vocals, high-pitched instruments) tend to get in the way of this.

Only support songs that are not from Apple Music, have no DRM, and are downloaded on the device. 


## Manually Installation of phunware-ios-sdk 
Build and copying the framework into your project.

## Usage Banners: 
Banners will be displayed immediately once they are returned from Phunwareâ€™s ad server.

The response functions are included in a closure passed to the placement request.

Creating a banner with 
```swift
PWBanner(placement, parentViewController, position)
```
- placement (currently, only one placement should be returned from Phunware, but in the future a list may be returned. For now, only placement[0] will ever be used.
- parentViewController (This is the containing controller that should house the banner. Typically this will be the view controller doing the banner request)
- position (A string constant noting where the banner should appear on screen. Positions values can be found in Phunware.MRAIDConstants)

## Retrieving a Banner:

Width and height are optional here. Most of the time the width and height will come from the zone in your Phunware configuration but if that is not set, you may want to set a fallback here.

```swift
    let config = PlacementRequestConfig(accountId: 174812, zoneId: 335387, width:320, height:50, customExtras:nil)
    Phunware.requestPlacement(with: config) { response in
        switch response {
        case .success(_ , let placements):
            guard placements.count == 1 else {
                // error
                return
            }
            guard placements[0].isValid else {
                // error
                return
            }
            self.banner = PWBanner(placement:placements[0], parentViewController:self, position:Positions.BOTTOM_CENTER)
        case .badRequest(let statusCode, let responseBody):
            return
        case .invalidJson(let responseBody):
            return
        case .requestError(let error):
            return
        }
    } 
```

## Usuage Interstitials:
```swift
Your view controller will need to implement the PWInterstitialDelegate interface to retrieve event information.

These methods are:

func interstitialReady(_ interstitial: PWInterstitial) {
     print("ready");
}

func interstitialFailedToLoad(_ interstitial: PWInterstitial) {
    print("failed");
}

func interstitialClosed(_ interstitial: PWInterstitial) {
    print("close");
}

func interstitialStartLoad(_ interstitial: PWInterstitial) {
    print("start load");
}
```
## Retrieving an interstitial:

```swift
let config = PlacementRequestConfig(accountId: 174812, zoneId: 335348, width:nil, height:nil, customExtras:nil)
    Phunware.requestPlacement(with: config) { response in
        switch response {
        case .success(_ , let placements):
            guard placements.count == 1 else {
                return  // interstitials should currently only return a single ad
            }
            guard placements[0].isValid else {
                return
            }
            if(placements[0].body != nil && placements[0].body != ""){
                self.interstitial = PWInterstitial(placement:placements[0], parentViewController:self, delegate:self, respectSafeAreaLayoutGuide:true)
            }
        default:
            return
        }
    } 
```

## Creating an interstitial with:
```swift
PWInterstitial(placement, parentViewController, delegate, respectSafeAreaLayoutGuide)
```

- placement (as with banners, currently only one placement will be returned from Phunware)
- parentViewController (The view controller which will contain the interstitial, typically the same controller that retrieves the interstitial placement)
- delegate (A class that implements the PWInterstitialDelegate interface. Typically the view controller which retrieves the interstitial)
- respectSafeAreaLayoutGuide (Some apps may choose to have their layout take into account the safe area layout guide in order to have the status bar showing. If your app does this, then this setting will tell the interstitial to do the same)

Once retrieved, the ```swift interstitialReady ``` function will be called. After this point you can display the interstitial at any time with:


```swift
interstitial.display();
```
The interstitial can only been displayed once, after which you must retrieve another one.
